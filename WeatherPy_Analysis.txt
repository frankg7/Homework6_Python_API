Three observable trends of our WeatherPy exercise.

1.  Temperatures were the highest in cities located around the equator (0 Latitude).  As expected the lowest temperatures were observ ed in cities further from the equator.

2.  Humidity levels look to be evenly distrubuted among both southern and northern hemispheres. Lowest humidty levels were collected among cities furthest away from the equator.

3.  Wind speed and cloudiness look to be evenly distrubuted among both hemispheres.  Highest wind speed and cloudines levels were observed the further away from the equator.
